When this project began Robbie, Mark and I all have different Cloud9 Workspaces we were working inside, and we were pushing to github.
However, after some time of doing this, we found git to be somewhat difficult to work with, especially through Cloud9.
We then decided to all work in the same, shared workspace to simplify the process.

This is the reason why it seems as though I pushed all the commits towards the end of the project.
